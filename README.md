# Lattice-Multiplcation-CS
A C# console application demonstrating matrix-based arithmetic.
# Lattice Multiplication Engine (C#)

A custom implementation of the Lattice (Gelosia) multiplication method. 
This project bypasses standard operators to demonstrate algorithmic logic, 
matrix manipulation, and manual carry-handling.

## Features
- **Matrix Visualization:** View the multiplication grid in the console.
- **Custom Carry Logic:** Manually calculates products using diagonal summation.
- **Formatting Options:** Ability to toggle zero-visibility for cleaner output.
